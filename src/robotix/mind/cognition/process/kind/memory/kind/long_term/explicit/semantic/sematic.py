    """Semantic memory refers to general world knowledge that humans have accumulated throughout their lives.
    -  Semantic information is derived from accumulated episodic memory. Episodic memory can be thought of as a "map" that ties together items in semantic memory. For example, all encounters with how a "dog" looks and sounds will make up the semantic representation of that word. All episodic memories concerning a dog will then reference this single semantic representation of "dog" and, likewise, all new experiences with the dog will modify the single semantic representation of that dog.
    - In semantic memory time doesnt exist
    - it is not personal unlike episodic memory
    - it is about knowledge and concept and events(as in episodic)
